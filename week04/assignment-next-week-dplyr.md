# Chapter 2 Select and mutate

Get familiar with dplyr's manipulation verbs. Meet the five verbs and then practice using the mutate and select verbs.

## Section 3 - The five verbs and select in more detail

## The five verbs and their meaning

## Choosing is not losing! The select verb

## Helper functions for variable selection

## Comparison to base R

## Section 4 - The second of five verbs: mutate

## Mutating is creating

## Add multiple variables using mutate

## Recap on mutate and select

# Chapter 3 Filter and arrange

Learn how to search through the observations in your data set (and extract useful observations) with the filter function. Rearrange the observations in your data set with the arrange verb.

## Section 5 - The third of five verbs: filter

## Logical operators

## Combining tests using boolean operators

## Blend together what you've learned!

## Recap on select, mutate and filter

## Section 6 - Almost there: the arrange verb

## Arranging your data

## Reverse the order of arranging

## Recap on select, mutate, filter and arrange

# Chapter 4 Summarise and the pipe operator

Master the data manipulation verb summarise, and practice combining the five verbs to solve advanced data manipulation tasks. Learn to chain the operators together with the piping operator.

## Section 7 - Last but not least: summarise

## The syntax of summarise

## Aggregate functions

## dplyr aggregate functions

## Section 8 - Chaining your functions: the pipe operator

## Overview of syntax

## Drive or fly? Part 1 of 2

## Drive or fly? Part 2 of 2

## Advanced piping exercise

# Chapter 5 Group_by and working with databases

Complete your mastery of data manipulation with group-wise operations and databases. Learn to use group_by to group your data into subsets of observations, and use dplyr to access data stored outside of R in a database.

## Section 9 - Get group-wise insights: group_by

## Unite and conquer using group_by

## Combine group_by with mutate

## Advanced group_by exercises

## Section 10 - dplyr and databases

## dplyr deals with different types

## dplyr and mySQL databases

## Talk with Hadley Wickham
